- Thank you to Tolga Ercan, and to everyone at Vetster, for making this meet-up happen!

##
<code>A very special THANK YOU to Simon Hamp, who has graciously granted us a temporary EAP licence to NativePHP for iOS, specifically for this meet-up. </code>

##
In December 2023 (was it a year-or-so ago already?!), one of our local devs did an incredible live demo of NativePHP at that meet-up. The question came up if it applied to mobile development? The answer was no, but the idea of mobile development was electric. Now, the answer is "EAP"! 

We are fortunate that one of our local Artisans is taking on the task of playing with NativePHP for iOS, for the purpose of doing a live demo at this meet-up. Thank you, Kwame Boateng!

As well, Simon may join us towards the end of our meet-up for some Q&A. 

Schedule:
6:00pm to 7:00pm: meet-and-greet
7:00pm to 9:00pm: Kwame Boateng's live coding demo

I do not usually exhort our local Artisans to actually click the links that I list. I put them there for reference. However, this time, I am exhorting you to go through the links before our meet-up.

Simon Hamp publiished a brilliant episode about the economics of NativePHP (Desktop and Mobile). Which is also an outstanding first-person real-time perspective on the economics of Open Source Software. There is a very obvious passion and dedication to OSS, and to PHP. I urge you to listen to this episode!
